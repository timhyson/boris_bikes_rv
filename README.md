Boris Bikes Challenges
London's Boris Bikes (well, 'Santander Cycles') are awesome. For a small fee, anyone can hire out a bike and ride it around London. Bikes are located at Docking Stations dotted throughout the city.

Let's go back several years, to the days when there were no Boris Bikes. Imagine that you're a junior developer (congratulations! That was easy). Transport for London, the body responsible for delivery of a new bike system, come to you with a plan: a network of Docking Stations and bikes that anyone can use. They want you to build a program that will run all the Docking Stations, simulate all the Bikes, and emulate all the infrastructure (vans, repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream a reality. They call it - guess what? - 'Boris' Bikes, and they're offering a tasty sum of money.
